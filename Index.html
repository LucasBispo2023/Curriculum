                    <h3>Basic Education</h3>
                    <p>Both elementary school and high school were completed at Santa Marina School, with graduation taking place in 2011.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Vocational Education</h3>
                    <p>During the period from Jan/2017 to Jul/2018, I attended and completed the music technical course..</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>College</h3>

                            <h5>Bachelor's Degree - Physics - Interrupted</h5>
                            <h6>From: 2012 - 2016</h6>
                            <p>
                                Despite being interrupted, this course was important for me as it provided me with tools to develop my skills in quick thinking, advanced calculations, programming logic, introduction to object-oriented programming with JAVA, working with data and tables, and understanding the laws of physics (which I consider important when developing games).

                            <h6>From: 2018 - Today</h6>
                            <p>This course is providing me with specific music skills and abilities, such as musical composition (which can certainly be applied to creating soundtracks for games), music theory, aspects of choral conducting and rehearsal techniques. Additionally, it is also helping me develop skills beyond music, such as leadership, teamwork, team organization, personal organization, analytical methods for studying, spatial perception, and basic project development.

        <h4>Um pouco de mim</h4>
        <p>Hi, my name is Lucas Bispo and I'm a music bachelor with a strong passion for programming. Currently, I'm 28 years old and seeking professional opportunities in programming, especially in the backend area.</p>

        <p> With some courses and an initial portfolio, I feel confident in my skills in Fullstack with Ruby on Rails, MySQL, Postgresql, Bootstrap, and Javascript. However, my natural curiosity has driven me to learn more, and I'm currently learning Graphql, React, and Docker to further expand my knowledge.</p>
            
        <p> I love the feeling of solving problems through research and self-directed learning, which made me realize that my true passion lies in the programming field. As a curious person, I'm constantly researching new technologies and learning about them, and I'm eager to continue expanding my skillset.</p>
            
        <p> I'm excited about the prospect of starting my career in programming, and I'm ready to work hard and learn even more. If you're looking for a dedicated and passionate programming professional, I'm here to help.</p>
